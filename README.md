Exploits
--------
 - HackCleanMaster has two versions. You need to make a bit code change for moving to another version.
 - Facebook exploit can be found here: http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2013/Jan/27

Vulnerable APKs
---------------
GO SMS Pro has two versions: 4.35 and 5.23, but I missed the 5.23 apk. So I only include a Manifest and Jar file.
