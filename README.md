ComponentHijackingExploit

Intro
-------
Here are the demo exploits and vulnerable apks for my HitCon'14 presentation titled **"On the Feasibility of Automatically Generating Android Component Hijacking Exploits"**.

Overview
--------
In this talk, we conduct an empirical study to explore the feasibility of automatically generating exploits for vetting component hijacking vulnerabilities in Android apps. Our study takes our hands-on exploit analysis for several real vulnerable apps as basis, and meanwhile reflects them to high-level analysis. Through this process, we identify several challenges that need to be addressed for a robust exploit generation technique, and some of them are first pinpointed. In particular, we believe one challenge is nearly impossible to be automatically tackled, if no domain knowledge is pre-provided. Overall, an automatic, accurate, and efficient solution for generating component hijacking exploits remains enough room to explore.


Exploits
--------
 - HackCleanMaster has two versions. You need to make a bit code change for moving to another version.
 - Facebook exploit can be found here: http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2013/Jan/27

Vulnerable APKs
---------------
GO SMS Pro has two versions: 4.35 and 5.23, but I missed the 5.23 apk. So I only include its Manifest and Jar files.

 - I am available for **part-time security assessments** for mobile apps (mainly Android versions).
 - I have a strong record for reporting numerous vulnerabilities in high-profile apps (e.g., Yahoo, Firefox, Evernote, Yandex, Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, 360).
